	<p>City council members toured New York City public housing units plagued by a long list of unsanitary conditions on Wednesday. For many residents, mold is a top concern and has been at the center of an ongoing legal battle between tenants and New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) since 2013. Now city council members are asking Mayor Bill de Blasio to expand the agency’s budget with $2.4 billion.</p>

	<p>The class action suit was brought to federal court against NYCHA by residents who suffer from asthma, stating that mold and moisture which the agency has failed to properly eliminate from their homes is worsening their asthma symptoms. While leaky pipes and mold have been an issue inside the city’s public housing apartments long before Hurricane Sandy hit the city in 2012, the storm created a steep backlog of repair requests and flooded units close to the water.</p>

	<p>The fourth costliest storm in U.S. history, Sandy shutdown “the city that never sleeps” and took the lives of more than 40 residents in October 2012. Yet five years later New Yorkers, like those in public housing, are still reeling from its devastation and the resulting mold growth. Their stories have the potential to guide storm recovery policy for both the recent record-breaking hurricanes and those to come.</p>

	<p>This past September was the most active month for hurricanes on record, with 10 consecutive storms. Hurricanes Harvey and Maria knocked Sandy from its second place ranking in the top costliest storms in U.S. history, respectively and Hurricane Irma came in at number five. The recent storms caused widespread death and destruction to Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Harvey in particular shattered records, drowning Texas with more than 60 inches of rainfall and turned major roads into gushing rivers.</p>

	<p>As months pass, media, government and public attention move on from the storm-ravished communities, leaving survivors to pick up the pieces of their lives in the dark.</p>

	<p>When the stormwater recedes and warm weather rolls in, mold takes over many flooded homes, consuming artifacts of families’ lives, pre-hurricane, and covering entire walls and ceilings in colorful fuzz.</p>

	<p>In 2012, Gary Grandstaff, a building inspector for the city at the time, looked for “the mold line” while inspecting rows of beach bungalows flooded by Hurricane Sandy in Staten Island’s Midland Beach neighborhood.</p>

	<p>“You would walk into the house, the building, and you would look for the mold line,” Grandstaff said. “And if it was above the electrical panel, you knew that the house couldn’t be lived in because the panel has been compromised now with mold and rotting and it could catch fire.”</p>

	<p>In the days following Hurricane Sandy, the New York City Department of Buildings (DOB) sent inspectors to determine whether flooded homes were safe for their displaced residents to return to in a rapid assessment program. From the day after the superstorm hit New York, Oct. 30, 2012, through Nov. 17, 2012, DOB inspectors conducted more than 82,000 assessments in the inundation zone.</p>

	<p>The things they looked for, Grandstaff said, were signs of structural damage. Mold was used to simply gauge damage, but it turned out to be a potential danger itself.</p>

	<p>Some months after Sandy made landfall in Midland Beach, Scott McGrath grew concerned when a vacant house near his own home reeked of mold.</p>

	<div class="blockquote">
	<p class="quote"> “Ten years after 9/11, people were passing away from all kinds of cancer — including my brother, a first responder. I don’t want to find out in 10 years that people died from mold exposure,” McGrath said to the Staten Island Advance in the July following Hurricane Sandy.</p>

	<p>Five years after Sandy, the borough’s coastal neighborhoods show signs of both the normalcy before the storm and its lasting effects. Here and there, walkways lead to empty lots where houses once stood. Derelict boats sit in wooded areas where the hurricane’s sea surge left them. Homes still boarded up have notices “not safe for occupancy” stuck to their front doors, while other houses have been raised for future storms. Only a handful of residents remain in the neighborhood Oakwood Beach, which has been returned to nature after the state demolished the majority of homes following buyouts.</p>

	<p>However, the lingering effects of Hurricane Sandy on Staten Island aren’t limited to abandoned homes and echoes of infrastructure that stood before the storm made landfall.</p>

	<p>For Grandstaff, he feels the effects with each breath he takes.</p>

	<p>In December 2016, the former building inspector was diagnosed with lung disease and given about two and a half years to live. After performing CAT scans and a lung biopsy, doctors believe his lungs became inflamed and scarred from inhaling mold while he was inspecting homes flooded by Sandy.</p>

	<p>Just months after his Hurricane Sandy recovery efforts, what started off as a cold turned into frequent bouts of bronchitis and upper respiratory infections that later developed into pneumonia. Grandstaff contracted pneumonia three or four times between late 2015 and 2016, he said.</p>

	<p>Doctors determined that he was particularly vulnerable to mold — he was diagnosed with Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis which then developed into Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD). The mold Grandstaff inhaled triggered his immune system to overreact which caused the inflammation and irreversible scarring of his lungs.</p>

	<p>Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis (HP) has many names such as Bird fancier’s lung and farmer’s lung because it’s caused by a variety of inhaled substances such as mold and antigens from bird droppings, animal fur and cheese. It recognized as a largely occupational disease due to repeated exposure of the antigens, but it only affects a small portion of people whose immune systems have strong reactions to these antigens.</p>

	<p>While stopping exposure to the allergens can reverse inflammation of the lungs in acute HP, chronic HP, like Grandstaff’s, can be irreversible.</p>

	<p>One of Grandstaff’s favorite moments with his niece was racing with her in his arms up the stairs of his Staten Island home.</p>

	<p>Now, he can no longer walk a few feet without losing his breath. He needs to be connected to an oxygen machine 24 hours a day, everyday.</p>

	<p>“[It’s] simple things, like I get out of breath eating,” Grandstaff, 69, said. “People don’t [think about it], you just breathe, you don’t think about it, it just happens.” Even with the oxygen, he is constantly having to catch his breath.</p>

	</div>

	<p>Every month, Grandstaff and his wife, Margaret, travel to Philadelphia to undergo tests and treatments to prepare his body to be able to receive a lung transplant at Penn Medicine. Every day, Grandstaff takes more than 20 pills — “some of these pills are the size of your phone,” he said. At the time of the interview, his lung functionality was at about 28 percent of its normal capacity, he said.</p>

	<p>“What happens is the mold goes in and now your body starts attacking your own lung and destroying it so what happens is as time goes by, it’s less and less and less of your lung left,” he said.</p>

	<p>When he was first diagnosed, Grandstaff was told he only had a couple years left unless he can receive a lung transplant.</p>

	<div class="blockquote">
	<p class="quote">“If I’m not going to get [the transplant], I’ll be dead — which is okay everybody gets their turn — but the same thing would go on, the next thing would happen nobody would be wearing respirators and maybe somebody else is going to get whatever it is, this ILD, that I got.”</p>

	<p>Grandstaff, whose last position with the NYC Department of Buildings was chief inspector of the Excavation/Interior Demolition and Scaffold Safety before, said he does not know of any other inspectors who have developed a disease similar to his from mold exposure. However, he said he thinks there could be others that may have had frequent pneumonia and bronchitis and thought it to just be a bad cold.</p>

	<p>“I don’t think they thought that it would happen to anyone,” he said, ”and neither did I.”</p>
